Remembering words in Quechua: I grew up speaking Quechua and Spanish, which in my country we call "Quechuañol". I enjoy re-learning and remembering words in Quechua because it helps me remember my family. Since I came to the US, I have found very little time and space to practice my Quechua. When I called back my mom and aunties, I could review some words, but usually our calls are not to practice Quechua but to update each other on how the family is going. Sometimes when I take notes in class, I find myself writing in Quechua and Spanish. I feel proud when I remember a new word and try to use it a lot during the week. I’d like to create something to include Quechua in my daily life.
### Problems
**1.** 
Practice Quechua while being far away from the community: As previously stated, the safe place for me to speak and practice Quechua has always been my home. In Boston, I found a good community at Harvard University during my first year, but after the only Quechua professor left the school, the community became inactive. Due to the lack of time and physical spaces(before we used to use Harvard buildings), we stopped practicing and meeting. **Non-Selected problem: We can work on creating more online welcoming spaces**

**2.** 
There are different variants of Quechua: In the east coast, you can find a lot of Kichwas from Ecuador and very few Quechua people who speak the Collao variant of Cusco, Peru. This may not look like a problem from outside the community, but it can be confusing for someone who is new and trying to practice the Quechua they learnt in their region. **Non-Selected problem: This is not a general problem for all Quechua speakers**

**3.Selected Problem: I think there may be a way to switch this from a problem to an opportunity**
Mixing languages: Switching between Spanish, English and Quechua(plus any other language you are learning) can make it difficult to remember which words belong to which language, leading to confusion and frustration. 

### Stakeholders 
**Learner**: Suffers from confusion and frustration when words get mixed.

**Family/Community**: They may also feel pride or concern about how well the language is being passed on.

**Language Mentor**: Needs to help the learner differentiate vocabulary and reinforce the use of additional languages only for specific, helpful cases.

Drawing challenges: Last year, I participated in my first [Inktober](https://inktober.com/), and since then, I have gotten obsessed with online drawing challenges. Since I was little, I enjoyed drawing, but I never got the chance to take classes. I started to learn "officially" how to draw last fall, so Inktober was a cool opportunity for me to keep developing my own style with the new tools I was learning in my Studio Art class. In Wellesley, we had a public wall where anyone could add a sticky note with their daily drawing. It was so much fun to see the different interpretations of the daily Inktober words in my friends' art.

**1.Selected Problem: Art is practice. If we lost the user in the first days of the challenge, we lost the whole domain**
It is easy to lose motivation after missing one day of the challenge: Just like people who lose their Duolingo strike after more than 100 days, it is always demotivating to lose your own self-challenge. A lot of my friends drop after the first weekend of inktober.

**2.**
It is easy to compare yourself to others: While participating in inktober I realized there is participants with different mindsets. Some of them feel inspired by their peers and others may feel intimidated to participate by the side of artists with years of experience. **Non-Selected problem: I think this can be solved easily if you participate in Inktober on your own**

**3.**
Creativity block: Some words of the challenge may be harder to interpret, and you might spend more time stressing about what to draw than actually drawing. This can take away from the joy of the challenge. **Non-Selected problem: There are a lot of resources for artist's blocks**

### Stakeholders 

**Participant**: Feels discouraged and may abandon the challenge entirely after missing a day.

**Community**: When participants quit early, it leads to fewer shared drawings, less feedback, and weaker group bonding.

**Organizer/Platform**: Participation rates decline when users drop out.

Using music to learn a new language: As a melomaniac and aspiring musician, I really enjoy using music to learn a new language because it makes the process more personal and memorable. When I start learning a new language, the first thing I do is explore their popular music. I often look for memes that I didn't know were in that language or songs from series and movie soundtracks. I started learning English when I was 16 years old, and I remember having a notebook with lyrics of my favorite English-speaking artist. In that time, I didn't know about the existence of Spotify, so I would listen to radio stations that included music in English. Sometimes I repeat lines out loud to practice pronunciation, or even sing along to memorize the song.

**1.Selected Problem: I think practicing and being conscious about the grammar is definitely more important**
Focus more on the song lyrics' meaning and not on the grammar: For example, I can memorize a phrase or get obsessed over the cool anecdote behind the composition of "Every Breath You Take" by the Police, but don't recognize when the verbs are in simple present or in future tense.

**2.**
Self-isolation: There is no need for social interaction while learning a language with music, so this can make people miss the opportunity to practice speaking with other people. I know there may be a possibility of people giving concerts of their favorite songs, but if they don't have a music background or they are shy. This learning method will make them feel more isolated. **Non-Selected problem: Since this is not the main way to learn the language, we can make sure to share the cons of learning without social practice**

**3.**
Songs lyrics are not the best example of real-life language: A lot of songs contain slangs and expression that may not be welcome in a daily life conversation. Also, it is very difficult to use music to learn professional or academic English. **Non-Selected problem: We can make sure we give this warning to the user before using our product**


### Stakeholders 

**Language Learner**: Misses opportunities to internalize grammar rules, leading to limited ability to use the language in real-life settings.

**Language Teacher**: Faces difficulty tracking the learner's progress in grammar comprehension if the learner prioritizes meaning over structure.

**Song Author**: Their writing styles impact the language learner experience.
