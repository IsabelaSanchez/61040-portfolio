# Assignment 1: Problem Framing
### Domain 1
Watching short videos: I enjoyed watching reels on instagram, youtube shorts, and tiktoks during the break times in the academic year. They give the dopamine dosage needed to laugh without compromising to watch a whole series or movie. I really enjoyed tiktoks of people telling story times of situations I have been through. For example, I follow influencers who shared about their experiences of being first-generation low-income international students in the US and Asia. Also, I liked videos of study tips, coding hacks, and design/drawing quick tutorials.

### Domain 2
Drawing challenges: Last year, I participated in my first [Inktober](https://inktober.com/), and since then, I have gotten obsessed with online drawing challenges. Since I was little, I enjoyed drawing, but I never got the chance to take classes. I started to learn "officially" how to draw last fall, so Inktober was a cool opportunity for me to keep developing my own style with the new tools I was learning in my Studio Art class. In Wellesley, we had a public wall where anyone could add a sticky note with their daily drawing. It was so much fun to see the different interpretations of the daily Inktober words in my friends' art.
