# Assignment 1: Problem Framing
### Domain 1
Watching short videos: I enjoyed watching reels on Instagram, YouTube Shorts, and TikTok during the break times in the academic year. They give the dopamine dosage needed to laugh without compromising to watch a whole series or movie. I really enjoyed TikToks of people telling story times of situations I have been through. For example, I follow influencers who shared about their experiences of being first-generation low-income international students in the US and Asia. Also, I liked videos of study tips, coding hacks, and design/drawing quick tutorials.

### Domain 2
Finding time to speak with family weekly: One of the most challenging things for me to plan is weekly calls with my family. I know it is part of my well-being, but it is a lot of time. Every time I call my family, it is never less than a 2-hour call. Usually, we talk over video calls or send voice notes when schedules don’t line up. I often feel guilty if a week goes by without talking to them, even though I know I am the one who is always busy. I’d like to find a way to make this a weekly habit that can fit all the areas of my life.

### Domain 3
Class scheduling: Scheduling Classes + Extracurriculars + Part-time jobs + Habits is a really exhausting job. Before I confirm my registration in classes, I used Hydrant to organize my MIT classes and Coursicle for my Wellesley classes. Once I got accepted in all my classes, I am able to move everything to Google Calendar, where I organize everything by color and type. Classes, Food, Work, Transportation, Study, and Wellness. Although there is no integral system where I can do all the above steps, I really enjoy crafting my schedule and seeing the final result.

### Domain 4
Decorate room: I enjoy decorating my room because it helps me create a space that feels personal and comfortable. I often do a first version of my decoration in the first week of classes, and I include photos, posters, and plushies. I like a mix of cozy and Quechua traditional decorations(like my mom's [llicllas](https://andeantextilearts.org/rosas-lliclla-threads-that-tell-stories/)), but when a lot of decorations pile up, I struggle to keep the room organized. I feel that my room is always a work in progress, and while I love the atmosphere, I wish I had a better eye to combine elements.

### Domain 5
Weekly outfit picking: I like planning my outfits for the week because it saves me time in the mornings and helps make sure my style shows up in every detail. I always look at the weather app and check my calendar to see if I have events coming up, like classes, work meetings, or special plans. Sometimes I get stuck wearing the same combinations, despite having more than 30 pairs of earrings and different tops and sweaters that can create bolder looks. I wish I could create outfits that go out of my comfort zone, but at the same time, that keep my personal style alive.

### Domain 6
Teaching public speaking: I enjoy teaching public speaking because it allows me to help others build confidence in their own voice and share my love for sharing knowledge. During my 1:1 tutoring, I support students with their body language, voice volume and dynamics, and their practice delivery. I also teach improvisation techniques and breathing techniques to calm the anxiety and nerves. I like creating a supportive environment where students feel comfortable learning at their own pace. 

### Domain 7
Good Sleep habits: I try to maintain good sleep habits because I know my brain and body won't work well if I don't sleep well. Sometimes I stay up finishing homework and starting my weekly work tasks. Sometimes the night is the only time when I can call my family, so even though I try to finish my calls early, family calls can last around 2 hours. I wish I was more disciplined about going to sleep earlier. I am conscious about the importance of sleep, but I am still figuring out how to keep healthier habits consistently.

Remembering words in Quechua: I grew up speaking Quechua and Spanish, which in my country we call "Quechuañol". I enjoy re-learning and remembering words in Quechua because it helps me remember my family. Since I came to the US, I have found very little time and space to practice my Quechua. When I called back my mom and aunties, I could review some words, but usually our calls are not to practice Quechua but to update each other on how the family is going. Sometimes when I take notes in class, I find myself writing in Quechua and Spanish. I feel proud when I remember a new word and try to use it a lot during the week. I’d like to create something to include Quechua in my daily life.

Drawing challenges: Last year, I participated in my first [Inktober](https://inktober.com/), and since then, I have gotten obsessed with online drawing challenges. Since I was little, I enjoyed drawing, but I never got the chance to take classes. I started to learn "officially" how to draw last fall, so Inktober was a cool opportunity for me to keep developing my own style with the new tools I was learning in my Studio Art class. In Wellesley, we had a public wall where anyone could add a sticky note with their daily drawing. It was so much fun to see the different interpretations of the daily Inktober words in my friends' art.

Using music to learn a new language: As a melomaniac and aspiring musician, I really enjoy using music to learn a new language because it makes the process more personal and memorable. When I start learning a new language, the first thing I do is explore their popular music. I often look for memes that I didn't know were in that language or songs from series and movie soundtracks. I started learning English when I was 16 years old, and I remember having a notebook with lyrics of my favorite English-speaking artist. In that time, I didn't know about the existence of Spotify, so I would listen to radio stations that included music in English. Sometimes I repeat lines out loud to practice pronunciation, or even sing along to memorize the song.
